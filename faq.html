                                        <li>Maybe! Regardless of whether or not you are in a mental health crisis, dealing with mental health issues, or need to work through a specific issue, you can still benefit from therapy! Even if you feel “fine”, therapy with a competent, trusted, and culturally sensitive counselor can be a great way to work through anything, establish new skills, and work on your relationships.</li>
                                        <li>If you are experiencing any struggles and obstacles which may interfere with your day-to-day, therapy can be a good way to work through these issues and involve yourself in a longer term commitment to your well-being. Therapy can often work in conjunction with other modalities of treatment, such as medication, yet is often used independently. </li>
                                        <li>Yet, the ways in which therapy can be delivered is extremely diverse, so make sure to find the best form/speciality and provider for your needs. Remember, therapy is not a one-size-fits-all approach, and everyone’s experience can look quite different.</li>
